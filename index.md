        I’m <strong>Your Name</strong>, a computational software engineer and applied ML researcher based in Zurich.
        I work on machine learning for signals and images — from inverse problems and generative models
        to modern tooling in Python and JAX.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2024, I’ve been building ML-powered signal processing systems at a startup. My interests include
        applied ML for real-world sensing, evaluation and robustness of ML systems, and building reliable ML tooling.
