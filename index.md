I am an ML researcher and engineer interested in building robust systems to solve real-world problems, and I enjoy the challenge of taking systems through the complete development cycle, from research to production. 

Currently, I work as a Computational Software Engineer at [Distran](https://distran.swiss/en/home/) in Zurich. My work focuses on the development of ML and signal processing pipelines for acoustic imaging and scene understanding, and their deployment on edge devices.

I completed my PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2024 at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) under the supervision of [Prof. Michael Unser](https://bigwww.epfl.ch/unser/). My research was aimed at the development of novel deep learning architectures and algorithms for computational imaging. Before EPFL, I received my Bachelors and Masters dual degree in Electrical Engineering in 2018 from the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IITB)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/).
